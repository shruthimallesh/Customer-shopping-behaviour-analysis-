# Customer-shopping-behaviour-analysis-

Data analytics project showcasing customer behaviour analysis using python,sql and powerbi.


Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, covering data loading, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, SQL querying, and business insights visualization through Power BI.
The goal of this project is to transform raw data into meaningful insights that support data-driven decision-making.

📂 Dataset

Source: Public / Sample dataset (CSV format)
Size: Medium-scale structured dataset
The dataset was first analyzed in Python and then loaded into SQL Server for querying and reporting.

🛠 Tools & Technologies
Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
SQL Server: Data storage & SQL querying
Power BI: Interactive dashboard & data visualization
Jupyter Notebook: EDA & data cleaning
Excel / CSV: Initial data format
